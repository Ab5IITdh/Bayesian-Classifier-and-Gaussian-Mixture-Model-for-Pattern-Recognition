# Bayesian-Classifier-and-Gaussian-Mixture-Model-for-Pattern-Recognition
This project involves the implementation of **Bayesian Classifiers** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** for statistical pattern recognition.

**1. Problem Statement :**
This project involves the implementation of **Bayesian Classifiers** and **Gaussian Mixture Models** (GMM) for statistical pattern recognition. The primary objective is to classify datasets with varying degrees of **linearity and nonlinearity**, using different covariance assumptions. The datasets are provided with predefined class labels, and the task is to apply probabilistic models for classification and image segmentation.

**The assignment consists of:**
**Classification Task:** Bayesian classification using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for various datasets.\
**Image Segmentation Task:** Clustering-based segmentation using **K-means** and **Modified K-means**.\
This project must be implemented from scratch in Python or MATLAB without using existing libraries for GMM, Bayesian classifiers, multivariate Gaussian distributions, likelihood calculations, or K-means clustering.
